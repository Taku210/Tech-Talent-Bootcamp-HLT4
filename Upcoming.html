                    <td>12:30 local time on Sunday morning, Aug. 1, it will be positioned several finger widths below (or 3.5 degrees to the celestial southeast) of the magnitude 5.8 planet Uranus. Early risers in Europe and Africa will see the pair closer together. 
                    </p>
                    In the wee hours of Sunday, Aug. 8 observers with telescopes in the Pacific Ocean and Eastern Asia regions can see the round, black shadows of two of Jupiter's moons drift across that planet together.</p>
                    The spectacular Perseid meteor shower, which runs between July 17 and  26 every year, will peak during mid-day in the Americas on Thursday, Aug. 12. That means that the best time for seeing the most Perseid meteors in North America will be the hours before dawn on Thursday morning, when the shower's radiant in Perseus will be highest in the northeastern sky.</p>
                    Each corner of Lyra's parallelogram is marked by a double star. Zeta Lyrae (ζ Lyr), the corner closest to bright Vega, can be split with binoculars. Both components are white — one star slightly brighter than the other. </p>
