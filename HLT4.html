    <p>Stargazing is a magical way to bring science alive and to experience the beauty of our natural world. Looking up at the great canopy of space is a powerful experience, which everyone can enjoy. What's more, stargazing is no.27 on our list of '50 things to do before you’re 11¾'.
    </p>
     <p> Grab your coats, find a cosy spot to lie down in your back garden or look out of your window.The longer you look up, the more stars you’ll discover. As you gaze, take some time to enjoy the moment - how does it make you feel? What words can you use to describe your special view?
    </p>  
      <p> If you’ve got a star spotter guide with you, you could try to connect the dots of constellations like ‘orion’ and ‘the bull’, but it can be just as much fun to find your own shapes. Try drawing them in your very own star diary. And if you’re lucky, you may even get to see a shooting star whizz across the sky... what will you wish for?</p>
